Nobody's doing this for me
Not even behind closed doors
Nobody's stopping this army
Because that's gonna start wars
I hear they wanna know my story
But they don't wanna know yours
That's 'cause I made music to make me feel good
Not to go on tours
But I hear that my tours just been booked
And I'm gonna make dough
I've never had money in the bank
Now I'm looking at a screen just watching it grow
Along with my confidence
'Cause these days I walk with a toxic glow
I remember the days
When I couldn't come out my house 'cause I felt so low
But wait, I was sitting on the 142
Or was it the 143?
Looking at my Sony Ericsson walkman phone
Nobody rang me
Then I look at my Nokia
'Cause you know they say I make money on the streets
But when you're in a bad place you don't wanna show face
And you don't wanna make P
So I just make music
Ask Ali Kareem I was a studio freak
I fell asleep on the sofa
And I drifted into the deepest sleep
I dreamed that I was in solitary confinement
And I was back in Stoke Heath
That's where I met failure
And it's also where I nearly left my dreams
